# [@dltn](https://github.com/dltn)'s homeassistant

I automate my home using these files and [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)!

Specific implementation details [are hidden](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/secrets/) for security.


## Notable examples
* [Cool-down Switches](https://daltonf.com/cool-down-switch/)
* [Smart Couch](https://daltonf.com/smart-couch/)


## What I Use

* Z-Wave / Zigbee USB Radio: [HUSBZB-1](https://amzn.to/3g60qQY)
  * Both Z-Wave and Zigbee in one package
* Power Switches: [Zooz](https://amzn.to/2AdApjo)
* Temperature / Humidity Sensors: [SHT31-D](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2857)
  * Consistent, low-cost I2C sensors easily exposed through WiFi boards
  
*Commissions from Amazon links fund future home hacking through the Associates program.*
